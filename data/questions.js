		description: `Everybody debates on this question. But I wanted to know the views of you folks!
          Is the argentinian star better than the portugese champion? Or is it
          not justified to compare them...
          Messi had a fantastic career with Barcelona, winning the Champions league 
          and golden boot, while the Real Madrid star is not behing in this respect as well.
          So on what ground can we differentiate?
