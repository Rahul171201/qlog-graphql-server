First, men aren’t lazy as a gender. They are actually very industrious. But they have different brains than women.	
This is a video discussing the differences in male and female brains in simple terms. I won’t summarize the whole video because you might as well just watch it. But here’s where the perception by women that men are lazy comes in:
			
Women are multitaskers and think about a lot of different things sort of at the same time (kind of). And their emotions connect from one thing to another (this is a part of what gives them superior emotional intelligence) They can't stop this. They can't just stop thinking (at least, they don't have this ability innately). They can't just NOT think about something that is troubling them. So women release stress by talking. By expressing themselves. This isn't just venting either. It actually helps that storm of thoughts and emotions in their head settle and give them some much needed relief.
Men don't relax this way. Their minds can easily focus on one thing, and not attach much emotion to it. Men see things as problems to solved practically, so if they are talking to you, it's because they want help coming up with a tangible solution. For women, talking itself is a solution. They don't want you to solve their problems. For men, talking about a problem without looking for a fix is just a waste of conversation at best, and stressful at worst.

So men relax by simply not thinking about whatever is stressing them. They usually do this by engaging in some simplistic activity that makes them look brain dead. Fishing. In silence. Flipping through the tv channels. Silently. Spacing out. Silently.
Women see this, and don't understand. They shouldn't be expected to. Men don't understand women’s relief methods either. But while men interpret women as emotional and illogical, women interrupt men as lazy and simple.
So women see men doing “nothing”, and they want to give them something to do because they don't get that men have to do this just like the women have to talk.

		content: `The question is full of concern for the reelection of Modi which in itself is an indication that he is assured of victory. Jawaharlal Nehru won the third election with absolute majority even after defeat in Indo-China war. Modi has not committed any such blunder. Also he is more honest than Jawaharlal Nehru, because he has not allowed any of his family members near his administration, whereas Nehru proposed his daughter for the President of Congress Party in 1959. Modi’s honesty is supreme and none can question the same.

Narendra Modi has done everything possible for the country. His foreign Policy is laudable with every country in competition to be friendly towards India. He has done more to the poor and empowered them. He does not throw some freebies like Indira or Kejriwal or any opposition leaders. He always thinks big and achieves the same. Whether it is Railways or Airways or Expressways or Highways or defence or startups, Modi has excelled. People are enthralled that the economy of India has surpassed $ 3.5 trillion. Modi wants to take it to the level of eight trillion US dollars.
People appreciate the good work done by Modi in a very short time of nine years. Modi is sure to win again in 2024 as well.`,

An important thing to note is that BJP is taking some important steps not because of their own desire in the country. BJP is taking the steps because these were mentioned in BJP's manifesto. So they are just fulfilling their electoral promise and nothing.
Do you still have doubt over the victory of BJP in next Lok Sabha election? Well, I don't have.`,

		content: `Attack on Titan is a balance of all the ingredients to a good show. It is the intersection of the best in every aspect, and in my opinion you can’t find any other anime to be that all rounded. Let me explain.

1- Excellent plot
The plot is very well built and of consistent quality. 
			
2- Diversity of tastes
Attack on Titan combines history, politics, action, (very little romance), cultures from different countries (Japan, Germany..), and emotion.	

3- Coherence
The plot makes sense in the world of AoT.
			
4- True to its themes
When the themes are freedom, war, the beauty & cruelty of the world, the necessity of sacrifice, tatakae (fight), betrayal, trauma and a lot more, it stays like this. These rules are not broken even once, so you won’t find an event that fails these ideas or contradicts the purpose. The plot will never deviate into something of totally other color.
			
5- Insane foreshadowing
This is due to the amazing planning from the start.
			
6- Development of storyline
It’s also interesting how the enemy changes from the Colossal Titan to titans to the government to the whole world. It keeps on getting more complex and serious, in a realistic way. There’s always more to what’s been revealed. You look back and say remember when we thought the big villain was the Colossal Titan ? Turns out it’s just a war between humans.
			
7- Characters
This is in my opinion the second best aspect of AoT after the plot.
			
7- Soundtrack
Honestly AoT has very outstanding tracks with its own flavor. Hiroyuki Sawano composed some very original and intense pieces. They makes the already iconic action scenes even more influencing. You may want to check out YOU SEE BIG GIRL, Attack on Taitan, Apple Seed, Before Lights Out and Barricades. Even the openings and ending are diverse. Sasageo is simply iconic.
Also the voice actors did an amazing job. Shoutout to Yuki Kaji for all the screaming Eren did in earlier seasons.	

Wow I wrote quite a bit!
Long story short, Attack on Titan is a bloody action series with a creative and original build, realistic characters with real suffering, amazing action scenes and animation, and perfect coherence. Isayama made something we won’t be seeing a match to soon. Attack on Titan truly raised my standards.\n
Thanks for reading :)`,

		content: `Ive watched many anime with equally intriguing storyline. The fact that AOT is considered the best anime of the decade, is due to its plot twists and insane story telling. It's something that gets you hooked after the 1st episode, leaving more questions in your head.

I've seen anime with great storylines which were at times slow paced, but with AOT it gives you unexpected twists with every episode. There is enough room for character developments and it doesn't tell you what is right or what is wrong… it just helps you contemplate for your own, on what you think will be right.
In fact my sister, who doesn't like anime (duh!) actually liked AOT, that she started watching it!

It may not be the best, but it definitely is one of the best Animes of the decade.`,

And this includes China and India, which make up over 35 percent of the world's population by themselves. The only countries in the top ten that prefer coffee are the U.S., Brazil and Mexico.

Generally, coffee dominates in the Americas and Continental Europe. But tea dominates in Asia and Africa. And that's where the vast majority of the world's population lives.`,
